# Lambda Calculus  
This project is an implementation of untyped lambda calculus.  Terms are 
implemented using locally nameless representation, as described in 
[this paper](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2009/ln/main.pdf).  

## Build
This project has most recently been most recently tested using GHC 8.4.1, and 
requires an installation of the `parsec`  and `containers` libraries.  See 
the included `.cabal` file for specific version requirements.  Note that the 
build-depends section has been auto-generated by cabal, and the minimum 
requirements are likely lower.  

From the root directory, run `cabal build` to install dependencies and build 
the executable, which will be located in the dist/build/hask-lambda 
directory.  

Documentation for the source modules can be generated using `cabal haddock 
--executables` command.

## Run
Running the `hask-lambda` executable will bring up a prompt to enter in a lambda 
term to be reduced.  From the parser documentation:

> No spaces, \\. to represent lambda binders.  Bound variables are 
> represented as natural numbers referencing their binder.  Free variables 
> are also represented by natural numbers, but with an 'f' character 
> preceding them.  Application is implicit with adjacent terms, and 
> parenthesis can be used to end the binding scope of a lambda.  
> 
> For example:  
> 
> `\.00` is equivalent to `(\.(0 0))` while `(\.0)f0` is equivalent to 
> `(\.0) 0)`, which is a beta redex where the 0 outside the lambda 
> abstraction is a free variable.

After a term is entered, if it terminates a reduction sequence to its normal 
form will be displayed.  Non-terminating terms cause an infinite loop
