# Lambda Calculus  
This project is an implementation of different lambda calculi.  Terms are 
implemented using locally nameless representation, as described in 
[this paper](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2009/ln/main.pdf).  So far, 
the project includes pure, untyped lambda calculus and the simply typed 
lambda calculus.

## Build
This project has most recently been most recently tested using GHC 8.4.1, and 
requires an installation of the `parsec`  and `containers` libraries.  See 
the included `.cabal` file for specific version requirements.  Note that the 
build-depends section has been auto-generated by cabal, and the minimum 
requirements are likely lower.  

From the root directory, run `cabal build` to install dependencies and build 
the executable, which will be located in the dist/build/hask-lambda 
directory.  

Documentation for the source modules can be generated using `cabal haddock 
--executables` command.

## Run
Running the `hask-lambda` executable will bring up a prompt to enter in a lambda 
term to be reduced.  From the parser documentation:

> A typing context is expected first, wrapped in square brackets [].  
> The elements inside are pairs (n,type) where n is a natural number and 
> type is a valid type.  Consecutive pairs do not have any delimiter, and 
> in the case of multiple pairs containing the same number n, the type 
> associated with that variable in the context will be the last in the list.
>
> Types are expected to be characters, typically uppercase, separated by 
> arrows, ->.
>
> For terms, no spaces, \\:type. to represent lambda binders.  Bound 
> variables are represented as natural numbers referencing their binder as is 
> standard in De Bruijn notation.  Free variables are also represented by 
> natural numbers, but with an 'f' preceding them.  Application is implicit 
> with adjacent terms, and parenthesis can be used to end the binding scope 
> of a lambda.  
> 
> For example:  
> 
> `[]|-\:T.0` is equivalent to `(\.(0))` checked in an empty context.
>
> `[(0,S->T)(1,S)]|-f0f1` is equivalent to `(0 1)` checked in the context where
> 0 is a function from S to T and 1 is of type S.

After a term is entered, if it terminates, a reduction sequence to its normal 
form will be displayed.  Non-terminating terms cause an infinite loop.  When 
inputting typed lambda terms, the term and type will be displayed and the 
reduction to normal form will be displayed.
